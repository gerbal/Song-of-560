If I surround something with backticks it's rendered in `code`

Here is a simple and ugly design because my dazzling design was abducted by aliens( not a cat on the keyboard).
I considered making it resemble a video game, but decided to draw a questionable house
complete with underground fireworks.

```
import turtle

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("#8FBC8F")
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("black")
tess.forward(100)

wn.exitonclick()
```

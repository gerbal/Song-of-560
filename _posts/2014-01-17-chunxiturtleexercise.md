It is a very simple turtle. My idea is a star is filled into the circle. It seems like I need to do more. To calculate more precisely. 
import turtle

Here is the code

```
import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("pink")
chunxi= turtle.Turtle()
chunxi.color("babyblue")
chunxi.pensiez= 4
chunxi.forward(100)
chunxi.right(144)
chunxi.forward(100)
chunxi.right(144)
chunxi.forward(100)
chunxi.right(144)
chunxi.forward(100)
chunxi.right(144)
chunxi.forward(100)
chunxi.color("darkblue")
chunxi.left(120)
chunxi.circle(57)

turtle.done()
```

Here is the picture

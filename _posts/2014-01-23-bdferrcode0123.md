# convert the numbers into days for bonus points, so I did.

You ask for "A pull request to our class blog with the code above and sample output from your programs." It is not clear where you want the sample output to be or how much you need, so I am placing one example for each exercise (except Exercise 5, where I am providing two) here.

From Exercise 4:
When you return, it will be Saturday.

Exercise 5:
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

Exercise 5 with the "split" command:
['All', 'work', 'and', 'no', 'play', 'makes', 'Jack', 'a', 'dull', 'boy.']

Exercise 10:
You are getting about 20 miles per gallon.
This is lower than the average for a new car in 2013.

Exercise 11:
45 degrees Celsius is equivalent to about 113 degrees Fahrenheit.

Exercise 12:
22 degress Fahrenheit is equivalent to about -5 degrees Celsius.
 
Exercise 13:
-9 degrees Celsius is equivalent to about 15 degrees Fahrenheit.

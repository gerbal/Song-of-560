* How do I open a pull request?

Monday Aug 26th Readings:

1. [Github Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html):  This is an article about the basic workflow we’ll be using to write our blog together.  You won’t understand everything in this article, which is fine because we’ll re-read it later in the class.  This is perhaps the most important content of the course, so pay attention.

2. [Github Flow in the Browser](https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser):  Recently Github has released features to allow the entire Github flow to happen in the browser (i.e. without using your command line on your computer).

3. Jekyllrb.com: Read over the site’s documentation and see how much of it you can understand.  Pay particular attention to the section on writing posts- this is what you’ll spend the most time doing.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Wednesday Aug 28th Readings:

1. Comoyo: [How we built our company blog](http://comoyo.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/how-comoyo-built-its-blog/) - Evidence that what we’re doing isn’t totally out of left field.  For bonus points, dig into some of the source code of their site.

2. Software Carpentry: [Computational Thinking](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/softeng/principles.html) - This is intended as a wrap-up essay but I often find it useful to ‘start at the end’.  Use the essay to orient yourself to concepts that we’ll be learning.
